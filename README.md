# linux_device_drivers

This repo contains my attempts to code the example code given in the book **Linux Device Drivers, 3rd edition** by **Alessandro Rubini**, published by **O'Reilly & Associates**. The original examples used in the book can be accessed from the author's website `ftp://ftp.ora.com/pub/examples/linux/drivers/`.
